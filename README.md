## This repository contains some of my past contributions to the Quantitative Finance Club.

#### *aggregation.py* was a task given during the application process to the club.

#### *id-replication.py* was implemented with the assistance of another Quantitative Developer and supervision and guidance of our team leader. It was the culmination of many weeks of work, and learning about WRDS Formulas and distributed processing libraries.
