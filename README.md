> “I propose to you the following question: can machines think?” — Alan Turing

I am an AI Systems Engineer focused on building the infrastructure that allows machines to not just "think," but to solve high-stakes regulatory, financial, and interface problems. My work sits at the intersection of **scalable ML infrastructure**, **agentic reasoning**, and **economic modernization**.
